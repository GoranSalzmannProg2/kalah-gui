Mancala/Kalah - all commands:
NEW <p> <s>:    Creates a new game with <p> pits per player and <s>
                seeds per pit. The difficulty and the opening player
                will be copied from the previous game, if possible.
                If this is the first game the difficulty will be set
                to 3 and the human player will begin.

LEVEL <i>:      Sets the difficulty from 1 to 7. Changes will be
                immediately reflected in the bots behaviour.

MOVE <p>:       Lets the player choose a pit from which to take the
                seeds for his move. If the game doesn't end after
                the players turn, the computer will make its move
                immediately after.

SWITCH:         Restarts the game and changes the opening player.

PRINT:          Displays the current state of the board in the
                console. The first line are the computers pits, the
                second line shows the players pits.

HELP:           Prints a helping dialog for the game, explaining all
                available commands.

QUIT:           Exits the game and stops the program.
